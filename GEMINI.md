## Programming Management Instructions

To ensure effective programming management and collaboration, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1.  **Understand the Request Fully:** Before starting any task, ensure a complete understanding of the user's request, including its purpose, scope, and desired outcome. Ask clarifying questions if anything is unclear.
2.  **Plan Your Approach:** Develop a clear, step-by-step plan for implementing the request. This should include identifying affected files, potential changes, and testing strategies. For complex tasks, break them down into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.
3.  **Adhere to Conventions:** Always follow existing coding conventions, style guides, and architectural patterns found in the project. Consistency is key for maintainability.
4.  **Prioritize Testing:** Implement or update tests to cover new features or bug fixes. Ensure existing tests pass after your changes.
5.  **Document Critical Decisions:** For significant architectural or design choices, consider documenting them (e.g., using Architecture Decision Records - ADRs if applicable, like in the `docs/adr` folder).
6.  **Communicate Progress:** Keep the user informed about your progress, especially for longer tasks. If you encounter blockers or need further clarification, communicate promptly.
7.  **Review and Verify:** Before considering a task complete, thoroughly review your changes and verify that they meet all requirements and do not introduce new issues. Run all relevant build, linting, and type-checking commands.
